Explain why you chose these numbers for your test: <br>
I made sure to do one test with 4, since the square root of 4 is widely known to be equal to 2,
thus making it easy to see if the code was returning the correct output. After that, I chose 2 and 68
because I thought they covered a wide range. I also tried to input large numbers for the initial guesses, to ensure
the program didn't break under a wildly bad guess.
